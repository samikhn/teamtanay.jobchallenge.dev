CLI apps or so called __command line apps__ are a fantastic way to learn language features and also to do some cool stuffs.

## Learning Resources to build them from scratch

* [JavaScript (Node)](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/command-line/how-to-parse-command-line-arguments/)
* [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html)
* [Go](https://blog.rapid7.com/2016/08/04/build-a-simple-cli-tool-with-golang/)
* [C/C++](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2013/01/c-argc-argv/)
* [Ruby](https://medium.com/rubycademy/program-arguments-in-ruby-ii-optionparser-ae24482568b9)

## Popular packages

Even though it is totally possible to build any CLI app with your bare hands(which we highly reccomend during initial learning phase) you can use some of the below packages to make your life little more easier

* [yargs - JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs)
* [meow - JavaScript](https://github.com/sindresorhus/meow)
* [cli - Go](https://github.com/urfave/cli)
* [click - Python](https://github.com/pallets/click)
* [TTY - Ruby](https://ttytoolkit.org/)
* [cli UI - Ruby](https://github.com/Shopify/cli-ui)

## Example projects

* https://github.com/sindresorhus/slugify-cli - JavaScript
* https://github.com/sindresorhus/delay-cli/blob/master/cli.js - JavaScript
* https://github.com/cdeil/python-cli-examples - Python

Similar approach can be taken for any language

Hey there! I'm Ameer working as a Software Engineer at Quantium in the day and at the night I maintain open source projects like [react-lazyload](github.com/twobin/react-lazyload) and build other cool open source projects. I'm an universal JavaScript ambassador and almost got into a fist fight when someone told me "This can't be done in JavaScript". I'm also an auther at freecodecamp. If you have anything to ask feel free to hit me with a DM in telegram.
