### why should one be a hiring partner?

> __It's always important to invest in young talents and the talent of tomorrow__ by Delphine Arnault

Being a hiring partner gives an out of the box recruitment option to the organization and would get an option for hiring young emerging engineers. India is a country in which almost 15 lakhs engineers graduate every year, and the recruiters have to go through all those applicants the good one and the bad one.

This challenge is about completing 5 projects in 108 days, along with writing 3 blogs reviewed by industry experts as we have industry experts as mentors for the projects. So, the recruitment gets easier, and you get all excellent applicants and bright minds.

_The challenge is completely free you don't need to spend a dime on this, all we need is you to invest some good intent_
