OlÃ¡! I am Tapan Awasthi, a young guy determined to make it BIG, a learner and a technology lover. Let me walk you through my intro and works.

### Introduction

My programming career started with Web Development and loved it always.
Passionate about building solutions using JavaScript, Nodejs, Express, MongoDb and  ReactJs. I like to build projects solving the challenge that comes up and learning whatever it needs.

## Why am I taking this challenge?

I want to improve my skills by learning and applying.
Also this challenge will help me be consistent and focused.
And, I need a job to turn my skills to value for an organization, all this time I was a lone wolf in front of my screen now I want to get exposed and learn how a team works.


## Something interesting about me.

I like talking about technologies also I am an enthusiastic person, it'll be my pleasure having a conversation with like minded people. When I am not in front of my code editor I'm a binge watcher:) also I'm a foodie, who likes to experiment with food and admire unique tastes, I like cooking too.

## 
### help I need?

A production level application must be always tried and tested thoroughly so I need help learning testing and optimizing codebase.
