#### why I like Python over other languages

_description_ I may not get bored working with this language and it would always help me to tackle my problems easily. I love writing code in python as it narrows down the lots of hectic stuff for me ,simple code format helps me to boost my productivity . And also the fact that it has very vast field of application. It provide larger built-in library which make it easy.
