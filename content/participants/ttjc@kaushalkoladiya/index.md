Hi! I am Kaushal Koladiya, I'm final year BCA student and self learner.

I am looking for job.In other words I'm hungry for new knowledge and technologies.

Like to watch technology video.
Listening music like pop, rock, etc.

#### why I like Javascript over other languages

_description_ I like Javscript because the main advantage is, it is a fullstack language. First I learn PHP-Laravel and it has coolest things and features, but laterally I watch a React live session on Youtube which is Tanay Pratap's than i realised PHP was my mistake but now my main focus on React.
