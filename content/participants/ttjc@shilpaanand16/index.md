Hi! I am Shilpa,let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

Currently, a student pursuing B.COM 1st year, 2nd semester at KSS Degree College.
I want to learn to code because it is very interactive and i love to learn new things.
I love to take challenges because challenges have become a part in my life!


## why are you taking this challenge?

I am taking this challenge because as a beginner it would help me to learn without procrastinating and when this challenge ends ,I am sure that i would have learnt a lot of new things 
,which would help me to stick to coding.


## something interesting about you?

I am a cricket addict.Whenever I find time ,i love to watch cricket matches.

### help I need?

It would be good if someone tells me what beginners should give great importance while creating a website.
