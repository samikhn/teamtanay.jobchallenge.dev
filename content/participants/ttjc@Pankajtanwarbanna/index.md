Hi! I am Pankaj Tanwar. let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

Ever since i was in my first year, software development has been my passion. I still remember 
building my first virtual assistant to perform just simple tasks on my computer
as Playing a song, searching something over google, opening any particular folder etc
using Python. Through out college, I worked on any ideas for projects
i could get, moving from "Virtual Assistant" all the way to Placement & Internship 
Portal for MNIT Jaipur (https://github.com/Pankajtanwarbanna/PlacemenMNIT), with dozens of 
personal & freelancing projects in between. 

So, now as a fresher, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet 
more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, 
I am very grateful. 

Specialities - MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, NodeJs) Stack, C++, Python3, Deep Logic Building & Problem Solving Skills
with a good grasp over Data Structure & Algorithms

## Why are you taking this challenge?

Looking for mentors and challenging job opportunities!


## Something interesting about you?

I am too lazy and love automating my tasks as building personal virtual assistant, writing script to clear cookies on Hotstar to watch 
10 more free min live IPL match, converting mobile scanned images to pdf on a single voice command and many more.

### Help I need?

I am passionate about scaling web applications. Any help would be appreciated.
