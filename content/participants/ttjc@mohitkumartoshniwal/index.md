Hi! I am Mohit Kumar Toshniwal , let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs .

### introduction

I am completing my BE from MSRIT Bengaluru. Interested in building some industry level projects using react and node and hence upskill myself as a fullstack web developer.

## why are you taking this challenge?

My main aim is to learn something which I can call myself a master, instead of being a jack of all trades(technology) at present and which will eventually help me in boosting my overall self confidence as well getting my right job.

## something interesting about you?

I am a very good listener and highly observant of my surroundings, bad at small talk but always there for meaningful conversations.

### help I need?

It would be very helpful if someone can give me more insights for nice project ideas based on my knowledge base in basic android, machine learning , Augmented Reality as well as help me out in pointing the direction for how to make my project, scalable, reliable and fault tolerant like in real world applications.
