Hi! I am **[Mustafa Saifee](https://www.saifeemustafa.com/)**, let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.


### introduction

I am a very community person. I like to network with *real* people. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saifeemustafaq/ "Mustafa's LinkedIn Profile") is where I am most active at. I enjoy DevOps and Cloud Computing stuff because I find it very easy to grasp. Simple
