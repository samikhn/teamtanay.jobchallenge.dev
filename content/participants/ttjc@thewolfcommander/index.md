Hi! I am Manoj Tyagi. I am interested in Programming and Web Development not from a big bunch of years but from only about 2 years when I have joined my Engineering in Computer Science as Major and now I have realized that it became my passion. I am pre-final year undergraduate at HNB Garhwal University, Uttarakhand, India and beside programming I am also working for my on-demand service startup [RIGTHBROS](https://www.rightbros.co/)

### Introduction

I am a lazy guy actually which sometimes helps me to find out the solution to the problem more easily. I am also a little bit shy and sometimes have stage fear. That's why I continuously try to speak in public

## Why are you taking this challenge?

I need a job.
I want to learn, explore and apply the new things and my knowledge to the real world scenario.

## Something interesting about you?

I am very good at poetry, expecially we call them "Shayaris" and just started writing Raps.
The best thing about me is that I am a very fast learner and whatever I do, I do with all my heart. The most unique thing about me is that Whereever I work, I work with all my heart, considering the firm as my own. As an example: During My Internships, I have worked more than 16 hours daily and sleep in the office at night. Also completed the tasks assigned to me in less than the half time.

### Help I need?

It would be good if someone helps me in making better User Interfaces because I am pretty good in Back-end development but need some help in Front-end.
