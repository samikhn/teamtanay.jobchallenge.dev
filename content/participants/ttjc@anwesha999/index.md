## Elastic Search on Resume Parser
_description_ Searching Of Jobs on a Resume Parser Via Elastic Search. 
I have hosted a demo dataset working on github which I have worked during my Internship in Tekizma.
It gives the search result based on the search criteria.
 It had 2 usecases. It mapped the candidate to the job based on the required skills, preferred skills, minimum work experience, candidateid, transaction id. Ranking was applied to give skill the ranks which further helped in the pagination. The other use case mapped job to the candidate.
 RestAPI was made for mapping the data into elasticsearch, indexing in the elasticsearch after pulling the data from MSSQL Database or through Json body passing, searching in the elasticsearch on the required parameters, updating the indexed parameters in the elastic search.
