Hi! I am Gajendra, a final year engineering student from GHRCEM, Pune. Let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

I love building stuff and experiencing new things. I also run a startup. My team and I are building a gift recommendation platform to help you find the perfect gifts for your loved ones.

## why are you taking this challenge?

Throughout college, I was mostly leading non-technical roles since I am a people-person and fairly good at communication. I intend to strengthen my technical skills by completing this challange. 
I also am looking for job opportunities, starting May 2020.

## something interesting about you?

I am a theatre artist. I have performed at Thespo 18. Thespo is very reputed amongst theatre geeks and is one of the coolst theatre festival in India.

### help I need?

I am just starting out with the complex stuff. I will be asking a lot of questions!
