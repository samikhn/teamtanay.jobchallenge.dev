Hi! I am Vedant Karia, let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

I am a first year CSE student from Somaiya Vidyavihar(Mumbai). I like to code as the final products always fascinate me.

## why are you taking this challenge?

This job challenge gives me an opportunity to consistently learn and improve my coding skills.
Also, because I'm looking for internships by August-September 2020

## something interesting about you?

I can actually remember dates and names very well, not sure if it helps in some way.

### help I need?
                
I still consider myself fairly new to coding so I don't exactly know what sort of technical help to ask for.

### how to contact me?

I'll update the blog link as soon as I've some posts up.
