Hi! I am Tarang Ranpara, let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

I am a 4th year CS student, currently interning at ISRO. I love to create projrcts, collaborate and meet new people. I'm a big time foodie.

## why are you taking this challenge?

Although, I'll enter the challenge little bit late, but this whole thing of "5 3 2" sounds amazing to me, so much productivity in such a small time! And the perk it offers is not cherry on the top, a job (of course if i complete this challenge)!

## something interesting about you?

I love to tell, and listen to stories! connect with me if you've got one.

### help I need?

I've experince in building peojects mostly by python till now, but from past 1-2 months I've started taking interest in JS related things, specially React!
