Hi! I am Goutam B Seervi let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

I am tech enthusiast. It started with a curiosity to explore what I can do with computers. In my exploration of the world of technology and computers, I learnt to design and develop websites and web applications. I also went further to learn to develop android apps and learn about cloud and DevOps.


## why are you taking this challenge?

I want to build a good work portfolio, also actively looking for a job.
