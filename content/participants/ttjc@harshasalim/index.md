Hi! I am Harsha Salim let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs. I have dabbled quite a bit in app development, and is currently exploring the world of Blockchain.

### introduction

I am a third-year Computer Science Engineering student from School of Engineering, CUSAT. I am passionate and highly motivated, and also highly ambitious. 

## why are you taking this challenge?

I need an internship in December 2020.
I want to learn.

## something interesting about you?

I love almost all genres of music, even the weird ones, and dance.

### help I need?

It would be good if someone tells me how to do auth for apps. Testing apps is a place I need more practice and help in.
