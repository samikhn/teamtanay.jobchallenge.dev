Hi! I am Jerin George and I am in my final year of college pursuing Btech in Information Science from PES University South Campus Bangalore.Love problem solving and seeing ideas come to life by building them through code.

### Introduction

I  love developing web and mobile applications,familiar and well versed with frameworks like REACT NATIVE||ReactJs||ExpressJs||NodeJs.Love challenging tasks and problem solving ,if given an oppurtunity would love to build applications that solve real world problems. 

## Why are you taking this challenge?

I need a job as i will be graduating July 2020.

I want to learn and be part of the dev community find mentors who could help me in my journey to becoming a great developer.

I also want to know more about Open Source development and would like to contribute in future as most of the things i have learnt has been with the help of Open source software.

## something interesting about you?
If I am not coding ,I am reading books on economics and finance,reading about dispruptive technologies like blockhain,love playing chess and discussing football.

### Projects

Few Projects I have built. Will be updating projects as and when I am done.

My projects:

#### A Social Networking Website 

_Description_:  Often People are confused as to which project would help them cover most frontend and backend skills together in one project.I found a simple social networking web application helped me cover most frontend and backend skills and was also a lot of fun in building this application.This application allows users to make an account,signin,follow/unfollow other users,view and comment on their posts.

_Stack_: MERN stack.Frontend was developed with the help of REACTJS framework.Backend was developed with ExpressJs and NodeJs.MongoDb was used as the database Used the mongodb atlas which is the mongodb cloud service.
