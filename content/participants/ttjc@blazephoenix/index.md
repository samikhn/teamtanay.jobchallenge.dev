Hi! I am Tanmay Naik, let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

I am a fullstack developer and have worked on projects using LAMP stack as well as Python.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I need a job and have been feeling stagnant in terms of growth, since I worked all this time by myself. I feel like I can grow
further with mentorship.

## something interesting about you?

When I was 20, I decided to drop out and start a startup and learned sales, digital marketing and graphic design to be all-rounded enough to start alone.

### help I need?

It would be good if someone tells me how video based apps work.
