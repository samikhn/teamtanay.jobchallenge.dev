#### why I like Javascript over other languages
I was introduced to coding with c++ in my first year of engineering, but lost interest as there was no one to guide me and we had to write lines of code on a piece of paper. Now that I have seen Tanay sir's videos on Javascript I believe that I can definitely excell in this field.
