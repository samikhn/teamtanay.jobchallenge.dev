### Introduction

I am a 3rd year student at MIT Manipal, in Computer and Communication branch and love the idea of everyone using something created and hosted by me. 

## why are you taking this challenge?

I need an internship/Full time Job as my fourth year starts in July'20.
Also, I have tried my hands on stacks like C++/Java, Machine Learning, but never on front end. Want to learn it well and make some good projects.

## something interesting about you?

I love watching anime and playing games, CSGO is the religious game for engineers xD.

I am looking forward to learn entire Front-End and Back-End development. I want help in any part I get stuck in and can't find an answer on Google.
