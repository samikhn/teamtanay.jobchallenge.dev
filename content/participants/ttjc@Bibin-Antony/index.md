Hi! myslef bibin antony and i am a gradiot. But i still have time undo my mistake thats why i am here. I want to start from square one.

### introduction

We humans are socialbeings and purpose driven thats how its been for a very long time. Which being said, I am better when i am with a team of like minded ones and purpose to pursue my learning. Mind is a void i always belive in filling it with things that really matter me in the present and the future, that's the main reason i just can't force myslef into conventional learning.(engineering). 

## why are you taking this challenge?

I need an internship in December 2020.


## something interesting about you?

Once i learned  basics for arduino  and phyton basics to code around for a science fair of my cousin to create a simple virtually yet complex for a begineer. The project was a submarine simulation.
