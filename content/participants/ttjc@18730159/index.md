Hi! I am Suyash Gautam. I am currently pursuing my Bachelors of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from Shri Ramswaroop Memorial College of Engineering and Management.

### introduction

I love competitive programming and have also participated and won a number of hackathons but now i want to learn web development. I believe there is so much to explore and learn in web development.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I want a job in July.

## something interesting about you?

Even in the toughest situations i can find a way out. In a hackathon my team needed an android app and without any prior experience I created an app from scratch for that competition.

### help I need?

It would be good if someone could give help in working with electronjs.
